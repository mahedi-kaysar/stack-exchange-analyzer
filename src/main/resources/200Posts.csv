"153724","1","153785","","2008-09-30 16:01:34","","751","1060930","<p>What I would like is a method to convert a double to a string which rounds using the half-up method - i.e. if the decimal to be rounded is 5, it always rounds up to the previous number. This is the standard method of rounding most people expect in most situations.</p>

<p>I also would like only significant digits to be displayed - i.e. there should not be any trailing zeroes.</p>

<p>I know one method of doing this is to use the <code>String.format</code> method:</p>

<pre><code>String.format(""%.5g%n"", 0.912385);
</code></pre>

<p>returns:</p>

<pre><code>0.91239
</code></pre>

<p>which is great, however it always displays numbers with 5 decimal places even if they are not significant: </p>

<pre><code>String.format(""%.5g%n"", 0.912300);
</code></pre>

<p>returns:</p>

<pre><code>0.91230
</code></pre>

<p>Another method is to use the <code>DecimalFormatter</code>:</p>

<pre><code>DecimalFormat df = new DecimalFormat(""#.#####"");
df.format(0.912385);
</code></pre>

<p>returns:</p>

<pre><code>0.91238
</code></pre>

<p>However as you can see this uses half-even rounding. That is it will round down if the previous digit is even. What I'd like is this:</p>

<pre><code>0.912385 -&gt; 0.91239
0.912300 -&gt; 0.9123

<pre><code>#
# This is the main Apache HTTP server configuration file.  It contains the
# configuration directives that give the server its instructions.
# See &lt;URL:http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2&gt; for detailed information.
# In particular, see 
# &lt;URL:http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/directives.html&gt;
# for a discussion of each configuration directive.
#
# Do NOT simply read the instructions in here without understanding
# what they do.  They're here only as hints or reminders.  If you are unsure
# consult the online docs. You have been warned.  
#
# Configuration and logfile names: If the filenames you specify for many
# of the server's control files begin with ""/"" (or ""drive:/"" for Win32), the
# server will use that explicit path.  If the filenames do *not* begin
# with ""/"", the value of ServerRoot is prepended -- so ""logs/foo.log""
# with ServerRoot set to ""C:/Program Files (x86)/Apache Software Foundation/Apache2.2"" will be interpreted by the
# server as ""C:/Program Files (x86)/Apache Software Foundation/Apache2.2/logs/foo.log"".
#
# NOTE: Where filenames are specified, you must use forward slashes
# instead of backslashes (e.g., ""c:/apache"" instead of ""c:\apache"").
# If a drive letter is omitted, the drive on which httpd.exe is located
# will be used by default.  It is recommended that you always supply
# an explicit drive letter in absolute paths to avoid confusion.

#
# ServerRoot: The top of the directory tree under which the server's
# configuration, error, and log files are kept.
#
# Do not add a slash at the end of the directory path.  If you point
# ServerRoot at a non-local disk, be sure to point the LockFile directive
# at a local disk.  If you wish to share the same ServerRoot for multiple
# httpd daemons, you will need to change at least LockFile and PidFile.
#
ServerRoot ""C:/Program Files (x86)/Apache Software Foundation/Apache2.2""

#
# Listen: Allows you to bind Apache to specific IP addresses and/or
# ports, instead of the default. See also the &lt;VirtualHost&gt;
# directive.
#
# Change this to Listen on specific IP addresses as shown below to 
# prevent Apache from glomming onto all bound IP addresses.

It is way too big and complex for doing this. In fact, it is so big and complex, that <strong><em>there are very many very bad C++ books</em></strong> out there. And we are not talking about bad style, but things like sporting <em>glaringly obvious factual errors</em> and <em>promoting abysmally bad programming styles</em>.</p>

(The regulars might mercilessly undo your work if they disagree with a recommendation.) Add a short blurb/description about each book that you have personally read/benefited from.
